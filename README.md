# Snake Game AI

This project is an AI-driven Snake game, inspired by the classic Nokia Snake game. In this version, the snake autonomously navigates and learns to eat food, growing bigger with each successful consumption. The AI improves its performance over successive rounds by learning from its experiences.

## Demo

## Features

* Autonomous Snake gameplay without user control
* AI learns and improves its strategy over time
* Classic Snake game mechanics with modern AI enhancements
* Developed in Python

## How It Works

The Snake AI uses reinforcement learning to navigate the game board, eat food, and avoid collisions. With each round, the AI analyzes its performance and adjusts its strategy to maximize the score.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/snake-game-ai.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd snake-game-ai
   ```
3. Install the required dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage

Run the game using the following command:
```bash
python snake_game_ai.py
```

## Requirements

* Python 3.x
* [List any other dependencies or libraries used]

## How to Play

In this AI-driven Snake game, there are no controls required from the user. The AI controls the snake, making decisions based on its learning algorithm. Watch as the AI improves its gameplay and achieves higher scores with each round.

## Learning Mechanism

The AI utilizes reinforcement learning to optimize its performance. It learns from its actions, adjusts its strategy, and aims to achieve the highest possible score by eating food and growing longer.
